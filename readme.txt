Thanks for downloading Richard Hayden's D3DWorld V2.0.0!

Version 2.0.0 of Richard Hayden's D3DWorld is a great improvement on version 1 (D3DScene).
Lighting is now used in many shapes and forms to enhance this scene. I have also improved
the program, making it more efficient and it runs slightly faster.
I have added a church-style building to the world (complete with stained-glass windows,
which looks pretty effective.
Six times of day are now simulated realistically using lighting. The screenshot below
was taken when the time of day was set to evening.

Next I hope to add collision detection and transparency and billboarding, to simulate objects
like trees etc. If anyone can help with the collision detection and transparency areas, then
please do. (r_hayden@breathemail.net). I also hope to make a more realistic sky.

So look out for any proceeding versions!

Please vote and/or provide feedback in return for me making this code available to you!
